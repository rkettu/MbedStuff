Some mbed programs I made that I thought were interesting enough to put online

YawFromMagnetometer
	Lib used: https://os.mbed.com/users/xeta05/code/HMC5883L/
	Calculates and prints yaw angle (-180 to +180 deg)
	using magnetometer data. 

PitchRollFromAccelerometerGyroscope
	Lib used: https://os.mbed.com/users/shimniok/code/L3G4200D/
	Calculates pitch and roll (tilt angles) from accelerometer
	and gyroscope data combined with a complementary filter.
	Used in UnityFlightProject for motion-controlled plane.

GyroParachuteDrop
	Simple height simulation of a parachute jumper. Turning
	gyroscope increases air resistance to simulate opening
	of the parachute.
